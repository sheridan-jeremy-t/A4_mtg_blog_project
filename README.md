This assignment continues to build upon your blog project.

For this assignment, you are tasked to style your base template using CSS. You will create a look & feel that best suits your taste and the content of your site. The design portion is a creative exercise, but technical considerations covered in this module will be evaluated.

- Create a base template with at least one content block which is styled using CSS.
- Create a home page (view & template) which extend the base template
- Render the list of topics contained in the Topic model in a sidebar
- Include the total number of posts using for each topic (hint: use query annotations). You may display topics without posts â€“ they will have a count of 0.
- Order the list by the most popular topic (most posts)
- Limit to top 10 posts
- Ensure that there is sample data in your site's database to appropriately render content.
